Hello CS 4540 Students,

Here's Assignment 5, due on Elearning at 23:59 p.m. on Dec.4 (Thursday).

The program involves modifying the internals of a working OS. You will 
write, load, and unload a Ubuntu(Linux) kernel module.

The specs are very long since--in addition to specifications for your 
program--they include examples, explanations, hints, and background 
information.
